This is not a code modification. This is a patch for asset files.
The binary was created with UABE.
The patch replaces 12 sprite atlases for common enemies.
These atlases were erroneously broken when the game was updated to 1.1.
This patch restores the original atlases.
The only difference between the two versions were the parts that were broken.
There ARE other misaligned atlases within these 12 and several other sprite sheets.
These misalignments do not show up in the game for reasons I never explored.
